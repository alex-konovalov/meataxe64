The C Meataxe64 includes a number of parallel implementations of
challenging computations. These take their inputs and return their
results in disk files, which can be read and written using <Ref
Func="MTX64_WriteMatrix"/> and <Ref Func="MTX64_ReadMatrix"/>. They use
a number of threads specified in the file <C>src/mtx64/tuning.h</C>.
Each requires a <A>tmpdir</A> parameter which should be the pathname of
a directory suitable for temporary files. 

<ManSection> <Func Name="MTX64_fMultiply" Arg="tmpdir, fn1, fn2, fn3"/>
<Description> This function multiplies the matrices in files <A>fn1</A>
and <A>fn2</A> (in that order) and writes the result into file
<A>fn3</A>.</Description></ManSection> 

<ManSection> <Func Name="MTX64_fMultiplyAdd" Arg="tmpdir, fn1, fn2, fn3,
fn4"/>
<Description> This function multiplies the matrices in files <A>fn1</A>
and <A>fn2</A> (in that order) adds the result to teh matrix in
<A>fn3</A> and writes the result into file
<A>fn4</A>.</Description></ManSection> 

<ManSection> <Func Name="MTX64_fTranspose" Arg="tmpdir, fn1, fn2"/>
<Description> This function computes the transpose of the matrix in
filex <A>fn1</A>  and writes the result into file
<A>fn2</A>.</Description></ManSection> 

<ManSection> <Func Name="MTX64_fProduceNREF" Arg="tmpdir, fn1, fn2, fn3"/>
<Description> This function computes the negative reduced echelon form
of the matrix in file <A>fn1</A>, which is returned in two parts. A
bitsstring in file <A>fn2</A> which indicates the locations of pivot
columns and a remnant in <A>fn3</A> which contains the entries from the
non-pivot columns of the pivot rows. The rank is returned </Description></ManSection> 

<ManSection> <Func Name="MTX64_fEchelize" Arg="tmpdir, a, cs, rs, m, k, r"/>
<Description> This function computes the negative reduced echelon form
of the matrix in file <A>a</A>, and writes
both the result and the transforming matrix, in a total of five parts. The result is given as a
bitsstring in file <A>cs</A> which indicates the locations of pivot
columns and a remnant in <A>r</A> which contains the entries from the
non-pivot columns of the pivot rows.  In addition, the multiplier,
cleaner and row select are returned in files <A>m</A>, <A>k</A> and
<A>rs</A>, respectively. See <Ref Chap="Chapter_Gaussian_Elimination_Functions"/> for more details.
The rank is returned
